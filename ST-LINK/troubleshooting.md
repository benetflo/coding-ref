# Common errors and troubleshooting:

- If you get the "dev_usb_comm_err", try updating the firmware of the ST-LINK/V2. If the internal updater in the STM32CubeProgrammer does not work, an extternal but official updater can be downloaded from here FW update
- If you get the "unable to get core id" and "no stm32 target found" error. Double check your connections, see pictures under 'BMC/docs'.
